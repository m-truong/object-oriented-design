# Library Application Design

This project focuses on designing a library management system using object-oriented principles in JavaScript. The goal is to create a hypothetical application that efficiently handles common library operations.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, remove, and search for books by title, author, or genre.
- **User Management**: Register users, track borrowed books, and manage user accounts.
- **Borrowing System**: Allow users to borrow and return books with due date tracking.
- **Inventory Tracking**: Monitor the availability of books in the library.
- **Fine Calculation**: Automatically calculate overdue fines for late returns.

## Design Principles

- **Encapsulation**: Keep data and methods related to books, users, and borrowing logic within their respective classes.
- **Inheritance**: Use inheritance to extend functionality for different types of users (e.g., students, staff).
- **Polymorphism**: Implement polymorphic methods for handling different user actions.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide the application into modules for better maintainability.

## Class Structure

### 1. `Library`
- Manages the collection of books and user accounts.
- Handles borrowing and returning operations.

### 2. `Book`
- Represents a book with properties like title, author, genre, and availability status.

### 3. `User`
- Represents a library user with attributes like name, ID, and borrowed books.

### 4. `BorrowingRecord`
- Tracks borrowing details such as user, book, borrow date, and due date.

## Example Code

```javascript
// TBD
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the application and interact with the library system.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Integrate a database for persistent storage.
- Implement advanced search and filtering options.
